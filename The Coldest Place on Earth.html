    <h1>The Coldest Place on Earth</h1>
    <h2>Two Ships</h2>
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The race began in the summer of 1910.
    </p>
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On June 1st,in London,a black ship,the <i>Terra Nova</i>,went down the river Thames to
        the sea.
        Thousands of people stood by the river to watch it.They were all exited and happy.
    </p>
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On the <i>Terra Nova</i> , Captain Robert Falcon Scott smiled quietly.
        It was a very important day for him.He was a strong man,not very tall,
        in the blue clothes of a captain.He was forty-one years old,but he had a yong face,
        like a boy.His eyes were dark and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;One man on the ship,Titus Oates,smiled at Scott.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;'What an exciting day,Captain!'he said.
        'Look at those people!I feel like an important man!'
    </p>
    <p>
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Scott laughed. 'You are important, Titus,'he said.'And you're going to be famous, too.
        We all are. Do you see this flag?'
        He looked at the big British flag at the back of the ship, and smiled at Oates.
        'That flag is coming with us, 'he said.'In the Antarctic, I'm going to carry it under my clothes.
        We're going to be first, too!'
    </p>
    <p>
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;

        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Five days later, on June 6th, a man opened the door of his wooden house in Norway.
        He was a tall man, with a long face. He waited outside the house
